Steps for running RSEM
======================

See documentation here for more info:

Also, typing in "rsem-calculate-expression" or any of the other commands without any arguments will bring up a help screen. In all the RSEM commands below, I have put the syntax for the command after "##command", including terms that look like "<something>". When you see this, the "something" will tell you what should go in that argument, and the "<>" characters are there to indicate to you that it's an argument, and should not be included when you actually run it. There is also an example command, indicated by "##example"

See the file "README_rsem_processing_and_edgeR.txt" for the exercises.
