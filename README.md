##RESOURCES##

**All of the following materials are available under the *resources* directory. You can follow the links in the text to find each resource.**

- See the [syllabus](https://github.com/UBCBio525/Bio525D/blob/master/resources/syllabus.md) for an overview of the course.

- The [Virtual Machine guide](https://github.com/UBCBio525/Bio525D/blob/master/resources/vm.md) has instructions for working with VirtualBox and the Virtual Machine that will be used for all practical sessions.

- For those wanting to work on their own machine, the [programs](https://github.com/UBCBio525/Bio525D/blob/master/resources/programs.md) file has a listing of the software used for each exercise.

- The slides, commands, or any other information for each topic are under a directory for that topic. For example, the directory "[Topic1](https://github.com/UBCBio525/Bio525D/tree/master/Topic1)" contains information for topic 1, the directory "[Topic2](https://github.com/UBCBio525/Bio525D/tree/master/Topic2)" contains information for topic 2, and so on.

   - There are two directories for each topic, one for the lecture and one for the exercises.

- If you need a quick refresher (or some help getting up to speed) on working with a Unix system, take a look at the [unix help](https://github.com/UBCBio525/Bio525D/blob/master/resources/unix_help.md) file. There are some resources there that will help you find the specific command you need for each task. 

##DATA REPOSITORY##

All the data for each exercise will be at: www.zoology.ubc.ca/~yeaman/bioinformatics

The specific files used for each exercise will be described in the instructions provided that day.

##NAVIGATING THIS SITE##

- To access a file or directory, click that file or directory on the far left, directly over the name of the resource. If you click the message in the middle of the page, that shows what was changed in the commit, which is not what you want to look at.

##OBTAINING ALL THE FILES ON THIS SITE##

The following is an up-to-date zip archive: https://github.com/UBCBio525/Bio525D/archive/master.zip

This method dosesn't require `git`, however, you'll have to manually update the files this way (by downloading the whole repo again).

A better method is to use `git`. To obtain to all the files, type:

    git clone https://github.com/UBCBio525/Bio525D.git

To update the all the files at any point in the future, change to the **Bio525D** directory that was created by the previous command and type:

    git pull
